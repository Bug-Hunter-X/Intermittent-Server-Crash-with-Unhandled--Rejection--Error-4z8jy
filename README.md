This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky Node.js bug involving intermittent server crashes due to unhandled promise rejections.  The bug is particularly difficult to track down because it's not consistently reproducible and the error messages lack specificity.  The solution provides a robust way to handle these rejections to prevent crashes and improve the application's stability.
